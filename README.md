## Hi there 👋

I’m Tony - an Electronics & Communications Engineer turned Software Developer, based in India.

I enjoy building simple, practical tools that make people’s lives a little easier.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading random blogs on HN, watching sci-fi 🚀, or at the gym.
