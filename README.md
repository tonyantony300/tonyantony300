## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Tony, a frontend design engineer based in India.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, youâ€™ll find me hitting the gym, watching Sci-fi, or reading HN. My current involvement is with open-source project osvauld where we are building the future without servers.
