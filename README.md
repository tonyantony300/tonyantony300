## Hi there! 👋

I’m Tony, a frontend design engineer based in India.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me hitting the gym, watching Sci-fi, or reading HN. My current involvement is with open-source project osvauld where we are building the future without servers.

Fun Facts: 
  - Starwars is my favorite franchise.
  - You probably can't beat me on a pushup competition.
